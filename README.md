## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the transmission of two digital signals over a shared communication medium using modulation techniques. It explores signal generation, low-pass filtering, modulation/demodulation, and signal reconstruction using both time-domain and frequency-domain approaches (DFT/FFT).

Key objectives include:
- Modulation of two audio signals with non-overlapping frequency bands.
- Efficient signal transmission and accurate reconstruction.
- Comparative analysis using FFT, convolution methods, and various modulation techniques.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Software:** MATLAB 
- **Languages:** MATLAB `.mlx` Live Scripts and `.m` functions
- **Audio Files:** `.mp3`format (e.g., `orchestra1.mp3`, `Song2.mp3`)

## Experimental Highlights

- FFT and IFFT tested for speed and accuracy.
- Effects of different filter lengths on signal clarity.
- Modulation frequency spacing tested to avoid overlapping bands.
- Reconstructed signals compared to original low-pass filtered versions.
- Optional QAM and SSB modulation included for advanced testing.

## Observations & Results

- Reconstruction accuracy improves with longer filters.
- Overlapping frequency bands cause audible distortion.
- FFT drastically reduces computation time vs time-domain convolution.
- Sound quality of recovered audio was tested by listening experiments.

## Project Summary

In this project, digital signal processing for the transmission of two signals over a common medium was comprehensively investigated. The MATLAB implementation included low-pass filtering, modulation, and demodulation of the signals. It was demonstrated that the choice of filter parameters, particularly the use of the Hamming window, significantly reduces rippling effects.

A comparison between DFT and FFT underlined the substantial efficiency gains offered by FFT, especially for longer signals. The project also emphasized the importance of selecting an optimal block length for frequency-domain filtering.

Further analysis of various window functions and the study of aliasing effects confirmed theoretical predictions and highlighted the critical need for careful parameter selection.

Overall, this project provides a solid foundation for further exploration and application in the field of digital signal processing.
